This is a beginner-friendly Python program that asks the user to input **two numbers** and a **mathematical operation** (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`).  
It then performs the calculation and displays the result.

## Features

10.0 + 5.0 = 15.0

## How to Run
1. Make sure you have Python installed (version 3 or above).
2. Save the code in a file, for example: `calculator.py`.
3. Open your terminal or command prompt.
4. Navigate to the folder containing `calculator.py`.

## Notes
- This program uses basic Python features such as:
- `input()` for user input
- `float()` for number conversion
- Conditional statements (`if`, `elif`, `else`)
- String formatting (`f"{}"`)
